## List of Java libraries behind my back:

| [Camunda BPM](https://camunda.com/) | My initial impression is easier to use than Activiti |
| [EasyExcel](https://www.yuque.com/easyexcel/doc/easyexcel) | Allows you to import/export Excel with annotations. |
| [Easy Rules](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules) | Simple, stupid rules engine for Java. Do take note that as of December 2020, Easy Rules is in maintenance mode. |
| [Faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker) |  Helps to generate fake data. |
| [Guava](https://guava.dev/) | Interesting classes include [Graphs](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained), [Multiset, Multimap, Table](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained). |
| [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io/) | Immutables generates simple, safe, and consistent value objects (data classes). |
| [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) | Alternative to MQ. |
| [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) | Use to keep track of database objects. |
| [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) | Aims to start with @Builder(toBuilder=true), @Getter. |
| [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) | Java bean mapping. take note to use with care with [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org). |
| [Mybatis](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/) | Yes, it can work hand in hand with Spring Data. |
| [Poiji](https://github.com/ozlerhakan/poiji) | Allows you to **import** Excel with annotations **only** |
| [Problems for Spring](https://github.com/zalando/problem-spring-web) | One of the library must have with Spring Reactive. It allows Spring Web MVC's exception or Spring Web Flux's exception handling to work seamlessly together, while requiring minimal additional developer effort. |
| [Spock](https://spockframework.org/) | Spock is a testing and specification framework written in Groovy. Probably the best way to write tests in Java. If not using JUnit5. |
| [spring-retry](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry) | Provides declarative retry support for Spring applications. It is used in Spring Batch, Spring Integration, and others. Imperative retry is also supported for explicit usage. |

| [UUID Generator](https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-uuid-generator) | UUID generator. Can choose a couple of ways to generate UUID. |
| [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/) | Object functional for Java. Used to complement Java streams. Especially nice to use with Spring Reactive. |
