## Java libraries which looked interesting but I never have chance to try before:

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [ability](https://github.com/ksoichiro/ability) | Reference library to build something similar to [CASL](https://casl.js.org/). |
| [Hashids](https://hashids.org/java/) | Generate short unique ids from integers. |
| [Jimfs](https://github.com/google/jimfs) | In-memory file system for Java 7 and above, implementing the java.nio.file abstract file system APIs. |
| [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org/) | Cannot use this quite freely due to license constraint. But worth taking note of it. |
| [jOOR](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOR) | jOOR stands for jOOR Object Oriented Reflection. It is a simple wrapper for the java.lang.reflect package. |
| [Mug](https://github.com/google/mug) | Interesting classes include [Substring](https://github.com/google/mug/wiki/Substring-Explained), [Parallelizer](https://github.com/google/mug/wiki/Parallelizer-Explained), Graph Utilities [Walker](https://google.github.io/mug/apidocs/com/google/mu/util/graph/Walker.html), [ShortestPath](https://google.github.io/mug/apidocs/com/google/mu/util/graph/ShortestPath.html) |
| [NoException](https://noexception.machinezoo.com/) |  Functional programming for Java exception handlers. | 
| [OACC](http://oaccframework.org/) | Java Application Security Framework. Very "chim" security framework. |

| [REST-assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) | Java DSL for easy testing of REST services |
| [RuleBook](https://github.com/deliveredtechnologies/rulebook) |  A Simple & Intuitive Rules Abstraction for Java. Based on Lambda expression. |
| [StreamEx](https://github.com/amaembo/streamex) | Enhancing Java Stream API. Good to take note of this for Java stream related operations. |
| [ThreeTen-Extra](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) |  Provides additional date-time classes that complement those in Java SE 8. |
| [TotallyLazy](https://totallylazy.com/) | TotallyLazy brings functional programming techniques to Java. |
| [Utterlyidle](https://github.com/bodar/utterlyidle) | Another REST library for Java inspired by the good bits in JSR-311. |
| [YAVI](https://github.com/making/yavi) | Yet Another Validation API. Lambda based type safe validation for Java. Good alternative to bean validation |
